# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome! to the Tic Tac Toe Game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
